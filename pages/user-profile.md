### 🔐 Account Management

An account is entirely optional for using GymNotes, and it enabled cool features such as Cloud backup. Here you can see the email you’re logged in with, log out, or delete your account entirely.

---

### 💾 Your Workout Data

Make sure your workouts are safe!
You can **backup** or **restore** your workout database with a tap, or **download** all your logs as a CSV spreadsheet.

---

### ⚙️ Preferences

Here you can customise how GymNotes works for you:

- Switch between **Light** and **Dark** mode
- Set your **default timer length**
- Turn on/off handy features like:

  - Floating **arrow buttons** to quickly switch pages
  - A shortcut to **jump to the next set**
  - An icon that shows **how many workouts since your last backup**

---

### 🛠 Troubleshoot

Something not right? This section can help:

- Try a **Full App Reboot** first — it solves most things
- Use **Search for Missing Workouts** if you think any logs disappeared
- Still using the old system? There’s a **Legacy Restore** option
- Need a fresh start? You can **reset all data** (but think twice before doing this!)
