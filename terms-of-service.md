# GymNotes Terms of Service

Last Updated: 28th February 2025

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to GymNotes, a free, offline-first fitness tracking app available in your web browser. By accessing or using GymNotes, including its optional cloud backup feature, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.

## 2. Acceptance of Terms

By using GymNotes, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use the service.

## 3. Description of Service

GymNotes is provided free of charge for personal use only. By default, all workout data is stored locally on your device. In addition, you have the option to create an account to enable cloud backups via Google or email/password. When using cloud backup, your data is stored solely for the purpose of enabling data restoration and is not shared with any third parties.

## 4. User Responsibilities

- Data Backup: You are solely responsible for backing up your workout data. While GymNotes offers local and cloud backup features, we do not guarantee data recovery in the event of device failure, accidental deletion, or other issues.
- Content Upload: When using the cloud backup feature, you agree that any data you upload will be limited to your own workout logs and related information. You must not upload or transmit any content that is illegal, harmful, offensive, or violates the rights of others. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if you upload inappropriate or harmful content.
- Lawful Use: You agree to use GymNotes only for lawful purposes and in a manner that does not interfere with or disrupt the service.

## 5. License and Use

We grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use GymNotes for personal, non-commercial purposes. This license covers both the offline app and the cloud backup service. You must not modify, reproduce, or distribute any part of the service without our express permission.

## 6. Prohibited Conduct

You agree not to:

- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to GymNotes, its systems, or the cloud backup service.
- Use GymNotes to transmit any harmful code, viruses, or engage in any activity that may damage or disrupt the service.
- Upload, store, or share any content via the cloud backup that is obscene, defamatory, illegal, or infringes on the rights of any third party.
- Use the cloud backup service to distribute or facilitate the distribution of such prohibited content.

## 7. Cloud Backup Feature (Beta)

- Account Creation: To use the cloud backup feature, you must create an account by providing your email address (or by signing in with Google).
- Data Storage: Your workout data will be stored in the cloud solely for backup and restoration purposes. This data is protected in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
- Beta Status & Local Backups: Please note that the cloud backup feature is currently in beta. We strongly advise that you also perform local backups of your workout data. In no event shall GymNotes or its creators be liable for any loss, corruption, or other issues arising from the use of the beta cloud backup feature.
- Account Deletion: You may delete your account at any time via the "Settings" page. Deleting your account will permanently remove all associated workout data from the cloud. This action cannot be undone.

## 8. Disclaimers

GymNotes is provided "as is" without any warranties, either express or implied. We do not guarantee the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of any information provided by the service. GymNotes does not provide medical or fitness advice, and you should consult a professional for personalized guidance. Use GymNotes and its cloud backup feature at your own risk.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, GymNotes and its creators shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the service, including the cloud backup featureâ€”even if data loss occurs due to issues related to the beta status.

## 10. Modifications to Terms

We reserve the right to update these Terms at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and your continued use of GymNotes after such changes have been made constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.

## 11. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the United Kingdom. Any disputes arising from these Terms will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in the United Kingdom.
