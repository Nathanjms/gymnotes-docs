# Privacy Policy

GymNotes does not collect or store any personally identifiable information by default.

If the user chooses to make an account, GymNotes uses the user's email address to identify the user and allows a backup of their workout data to be stored in the cloud. This data is not ever shared with any third parties, and is only used for the purpose of enabling a user to store a backup of their workout logs.

You can delete your account at any time by going to the "Settings" page and clicking the "Delete Account" button, which will only appear when you are logged in. This will delete your account and all of your workout data from the cloud. Please note that action cannot be undone.
