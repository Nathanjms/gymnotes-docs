# Getting Started

The aim of GymNotes is to be very simple and easy to use, so to get started, load the web app and click "Begin Workout" to choose from one of over 80 pre-defined exercises!

If you want to use more advanced features, most are explained within the app, and you can use this documentation as a reference.
