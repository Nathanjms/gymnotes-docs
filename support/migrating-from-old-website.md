# Migrating from Old Website

GymNotes has moved from it's old home at _https://gymnotes.uk_ to _https://app.gymnotes.co.uk_. Because your workout data is stored per website, you need to move this data across from the old website to the new. It is important to do this as soon as possible, because the old websites may become unavailable in the future.

## Guide

### Moving from _gymnotes.uk_ to _app.gymnotes.co.uk_

1. From the GymNotes dashboard, click the 'Settings' icon.
2. In Settings, go to the 'Workout Data' section and click 'Backup'.
3. Here, you can either download your workout data into a backup file, or back it up to the cloud (if you are logged in).
   1. Bonus tip: Consider doing a backup regularly to keep a convenient way to restore data if needed.
4. Once this is done, you are ready to move to the new site.
5. Go to https://app.gymnotes.co.uk/, and click the 'Settings' icon.
6. In Settings, go to the 'Workout Data' section and click 'Restore'.
7. Here, you can either upload your backup file, or restore it from the cloud (after logging in).
8. Your workout data is restored and ready to use, congratulations!

Once this is done, if you are using GymNotes as an app (recommended), you can now remove the old icon from your home screen, and re-add the new one. This differs for iOS and Android, see [this page for details](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/Installing#installing_pwas).

### Moving from _gymnotes.co.uk_ to _app.gymnotes.co.uk_

<!-- This will need updating once we make the docs become the base domain! -->
Currently this is the same as the above, please see the above.

## FAQs

### Why Have you Moved?

I develop and run GymNotes in my spare time. WHile I do what I can to keep costs down, the domain itself costs me to renew each year. Because of this, I've made the decision to reduce the number of domains for GymNotes down from 2 to 1.

### Will this be Moved again?

I have zero intentions to move away from the new domain, and so the answer to this is no. If this will ever change, I will be sure to give as much notice as possible, but personally think we've found the permanent home for GymNotes!

### This is really inconvenient to me!

That's not a question, but I'll apologise for the inconvenience anyway! Hopefully you understand that this helps GymNotes be set up for the long term. Feel free to get in touch with any suggestions/improvements and I'll take it all on board! The easiest way to to this is probably to fill out the form on GymNotes.
